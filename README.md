# Numerical-Analysis
This repository contains codes that I worked on while studying Numerical Analysis and depicts mathematical functions and theorems in Python.
The Composite Trapezoid Rule: an algorithm to use trapezoids to solve integrals. Can adjust for how many trapezoids you would like.
Approximation and Convergence: Deals with extrapolating functions and figuring out if they converge.
Lebsegue function: the integration of functions over measurable sets.
Legendre Polynomials: complete and orthogonal polynomials with a vast number of mathematical properties and numerous applications.
